    "Before, Longgun Town had 32 urban minimum living guarantee households with 59 people; rural minimum living guarantee households had 1022 households with 1320 people; and the five guarantees in rural areas supported 125 people.",
    "Longgun Town has been growing pineapples for more than 30 years. Since the introduction of Bali pineapples in 1984, pineapples have taken root and grown in this hot soil. Longgun has also become the largest pineapple production base in Wanning City. After many years, Longgun Pineapple gradually went out of Wanning, Hainan, broke into the world, and created the \"Dragon Pineapple\" brand all the way.",
    "However, with the intensification of market competition and the expansion of planting areas, the profits of the pineapple industry have gradually been compressed and the forest land has turned into sand dunes. The enthusiasm of farmers and the quality of pineapple have been affected. To this end, Longgun Town promotes new technologies such as ridge planting, film mulching, stalk picking, manual weed removal, integrated fertilization of water and fertilizer, etc., and introduces new varieties such as golden pineapple and Tainong series to make \"longroll pineapple\" The industry is taking it to the next level.",
    "In October 2019, the Wanning Lvlong Planting Professional Cooperative adopted the development model of \"cooperative + farmers\" and tried to plant jackfruit in a new type of ecological interplanting in pineapple fields. After 8 months of careful management, the fruit seedlings and saplings of the new ecological interplanting base of pineapple and jackfruit of 150 acres are growing well.",
    "On July 6, 2020, on Tiantianling, a group of villagers from Duanxi Village Committee of Duanxi Village, Longgun Town, Wanning City, a 150-mu pineapple field grown by a cooperative was growing well with jackfruit. This is also the first attempt in Longgun Town to explore a new ecological interplanting model of pineapple and jackfruit, and it has achieved initial success.",
    "Both pineapple and jackfruit are grown at the same time, and the two can be interplanted without wasting time and land. He has been following the jackfruit industry for at least 12 years. From its planting, management, sales and deep processing, he has traveled all over the island. It was not until last year that he started professionally planting jackfruit on circulation sites. In the process of management and protection, the ecological interplanting project helped an orphan and a poor household in the local area to find employment. At the same time, the farmers participating in planting are taught to master the key points of interplanting technology, as well as technical specifications such as fertilization and spraying. The next step is to put time on the sales and logistics after the later collection, so that the fruit is produced and sold smoothly.",
    "Among the 100 employees, 91 impoverished households have all been lifted out of poverty. This is the poverty alleviation achievement of the Wanning Jimin Fruit and Vegetable Production and Marketing Cooperative, and it is also the epitome of the Longgun Pineapple Industry's contribution to poverty alleviation."
