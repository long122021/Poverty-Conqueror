## Short Description <a name="Short-Description"></a>

### What's the problem?
On September 25-27, 2015, 193 member states unanimously adopted "Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development" at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit with 17 sustainable development goals as the core. The three levels: society, economy, and environment, as well as important aspects related to peace, disputes and university institutions, and confirm the mobilization of implementation means, including financial resources, technology development and transfer, and capacity building. The agenda was officially launched on January 1, 2016, calling on all countries to take action to achieve 17 sustainable development goals in the next 15 years. As the largest developing country in the world, China has already achieved a complete alleviation of poverty through a variety of different programs. However, there are still 1.3 billion people living in multidimensional poverty in other parts of the world, accompanied by multiple problems such as hunger, high disease rates, and low education levels. The problem of poverty has become an important factor restricting human development.


### How can technology help?

* Information database of impoverished areas：Enter the area to match the basic characteristics of the area, including 8 dimensions such as climate, altitude, topography, soil quality, and annual precipitation.
* Recommendations for poverty alleviation programs：Including industry recommendations, references to successful cases of poverty alleviation in China, and recommendations from service support organizations.
* Information platform：The help-seeking party releases help-seeking information, and the assisting party releases poverty alleviation information to establish a communication channel for the help-seeking party and the donor in the development of poverty alleviation.
